…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# ReactAWS_Amplify" >> README.md git init git add README.md git commit -m "first commit" git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/adamsawyer391/ReactAWS_Amplify.git git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/adamsawyer391/ReactAWS_Amplify.git git branch -M main git push -u origin main
